Greetings Humans,

Just as you, I am an organic meatbag filled with bodily fluids. I am currently studying biology, to better understand other forms of flesh constructs, which I also am.
I enjoy normal organic timewasting activities, such as submerging myself in large bodies of water, reading about fictional worlds and competing against other in virtual arena's.
Also, I am not a robot.
